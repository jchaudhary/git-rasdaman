PetaScope
---------

This file is part of PetaScope, a free implementation of the Open GeoSpatial Consortium (OGC, 
www.opengeospatial.org) Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards suite. As such, it implements the 
following interface standards:
    - Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0
    - Web Coverage Service (WCS) 1.1.2
    - Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) 1.0.0
    - WCS Transaction Extension (WCS-T) 1.4.0

PetaScope is implemented as a Java servlet. As such, it relies on the following
freely available components which are not part of the PetaScope distribution:
    - rasdaman (www.rasdaman.org) as raster server
    - Tomcat (tomcat.apache.org) as servlet container
    - PostgreSQL (www.postgresql.org) as relational database system


Distribution
------------

A PetaScope distribution consists of the following directories and files:

db/                  Scripts to initialize and maintain the PetaScope database
lib/                 External libraries required
nbproject/			 NetBeans project build files and properties.
src/                 Source code
src/main/resources/settings.properties
                     Default servlet initialization parameters, such as database
                     connections. It's best to copy manually this file to
                     db/settings.properties and adapt to the local environment.
