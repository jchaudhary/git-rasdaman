-- update_petascopedb.sh

Automate update of the petascope database. This script expects a local
`petascope.properties` file, if it is not found then it automatically copies the
default sample file from src/main/resources. It is recommended that you
manually copy the sample file and adapt to your environment if needed, and then
execute `update_petascopedb.sh`.

When installing petascope for the first time, `update_petascopedb.sh` will create the
initial database. Otherwise it will only try migrating existing covereges in case
the `--migrate` option is set.

In either case, it expect a PostgreSQL user that can modify the configured database 
and can login via ident authentication.

IMPORTANT: do not execute `update_petascopedb.sh` with sh, but with bash. Best is to
`chmod +x update_petascopedb.sh`, and execute it with `./update_petascopedb.sh`.

-- petascope/*.sql

These files contain SQL statements for the creation of the database schema, 
and for migrating existing coverages in the old PS_* tables.

Currently, the prefix ``PS9_'' will prepend the tables' names for Petascope 9.
To visualize the schema structure look into the
`<rasdaman>/manuals_and_examples/manuals/doc-petascope/dbschema/' folder for help.
To see the available tables and triggers from command line, type:

petascopedb=# \dt ps9_*
petascopedb=# \dft

To migrate the existing coverages in PS_* tables to PS9_* ones, run the update script with
the `--migrate` option set.
